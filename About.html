  <h2>
    Welcome to my website. I am the coder and designer of this website,
    <br>
    this website is more as a test so I can improve my html coding skills.
    <br>
    Me and my friend are trying to build websites and see which website is better.
    <br>
    But I have a little bit more experience in building websites and coding, but that doesn't mean I will win.
    <br>
    But I'm still interested in where this hobby will go, I guess only time will tell!.</h2>

  <h2>
    Two or more weeks have passed since we started.
    <br>
    I have made a lot of progress in learning html but also learnt css
    <br>
    in the process. My friend has not made any progress in building or learning about html coding.
    <br>
    But i'm not surprised. And it would take a lot of more time for my friend to build the website
    <br>
    becouse they probably will need a lot of time to learn all this.
    <br>
    Lets just say they are not very interested in coding or learning to code even if they say they are.</h2>
